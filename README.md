# Lambda-NFA (Î»-NFA)

**Assignment**: Write an algorithm that has as input a lambda-NFA and a list of strings. Display YES/NO for each word, if it is accepted or not. If the answear is YES, display a path that can be used to reach a destination node. 

The symbol for lambda is #, therefore it cannot be used as a transition symbol with another meaning.

## How to use
We read from file date.in:

n (number of states), m (number of transition)

m transition (start node, destination node, transition)

source node

number of final nodes, final nodes

number of strings

the strings.
